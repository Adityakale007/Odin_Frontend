# 🌌 Space Route Optimizer  

Space Route Optimizer is an interactive space navigation simulator that calculates the **shortest and fastest path from Earth to the Moon**, intelligently avoiding **space debris** and **planetary radiation fields**. This project combines **astrophysics-inspired algorithms** with **visual radar simulation** to help visualize safe and efficient lunar travel routes.  

## 🚀 Features  

🛰️ **Optimal Route Calculation**  
Uses advanced algorithms to compute the best possible path to the Moon, balancing both travel time and safety.  

🌍 **Dynamic Space Debris Detection**  
Maps hazardous orbital debris and dynamically re-routes to avoid collisions.  

☢️ **Radiation Belt Awareness**  
Identifies dangerous planetary radiation zones (e.g., Van Allen Belts) and minimizes exposure.  

📡 **Radar Visualization Interface**  
Displays the Earth, Moon, debris fields, and calculated path in a radar-style layout for intuitive navigation.  

🎞️ **Animated Transitions**  
Seamless page changes and component animations using Framer Motion.  

💾 **Modular & Extensible Architecture**  
Easily adaptable for multi-planet routing and future expansion.
